   
This is a subdirectory for storing *.f and *.F files.

1. *.f files are those which have been preprocessed by cpp.
   These will already include the "include" files.
2. *.F files those which have not been preprocessed by cpp.
3. *.incl are include for the *.F files.

If a single file is desired for listing purposes, one could
simply 

'cat *.f > mm5_pick.listing' 

which lists all of the subroutines alphabetically.
Or if one desires to place the main program at the beginning
of the mm5_pick.f file, one could

'mv mm5.f mm5_pick.listing; cat *.f >> mm5_pick.listing'
