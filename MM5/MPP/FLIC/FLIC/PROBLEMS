C 1.  FLIC does not handle functions
C 2.  FLIC does not handle files with multiple subroutines.
C 3.  FLIC does not properly handle this: (adapted from sint.F)

      subroutine bug3
      real a(mix,mjx),b(mix,mjx)
      integer igo(mix,mjx),jgo(mix,mjx) ! assume entries are local indices
      do ii = 1, il
        do j = -2, 2		! should not be converted but is
          do i = -2, 2		! should not be converted but is
            do jj = 1, jl
              a(ii,jj) = b(igo(ii,jj)+i,jgo(ii,jj)+j)
            enddo
          enddo
        enddo
      enddo
      end

C 4.  Flic puts a lot of the IFLICT_ and JFLICT_ constant assignments
C     at the beginning of the routine (as first executables).  Got
C     into trouble with this in solve3.F, because there was a call
C     to MP_INITDOMAIN there that changed the state of the model
C     to for a different nest level.  But this ended up occurring
C     *after* the IFLICT and JFLICT variables had already been set
C     using old state for the prev. nest.  Temporary solution was
C     to move call call to MP_INITDOMAIN out of solve3 into the caller.

C 5.  FLIC doesn't handle multiple instances of a local to global 
C     index conversion in a conditional:
C
C       if(inest.eq.2.and.(j.eq.28.or.j.eq.29))then
C
Cconverts to:
C
C       IF(INEST.EQ.2.AND.((((J)-jdif_x0) ).EQ.28.OR.J.EQ.29))THEN
C                                                    ^^^^^^^
C                                               didn't get converted
C      FIXED -- MODIFIED CODE AT THE BOTTOM
C      OF depends_on.c; parenK nodes weren't handing back more than
C      the first one from their subexpression.
