This note concerns debugging the VECTOR=1 option in the MM5
configure.user file. This option is currently used in Sections 7f
(Fujitsu) and 7h (NEC SX/5). It may be more convenient to compile and
run the vector modification on a workstation or other non-vector
computer. To modify the code so that it will run on Compaq
platform, do the following (the steps are written for she.mmm.ucar.edu,
a Compaq 4100 cluster at MMM):

1. Add "VECTOR=1" (no quotes) as a line in Section 7e of configure.user

2. Add "FLIC_MACROS = LMvpp.m4" (no quotes) as a line in Section 7e of
   configure.user

3. Change RUNTIME_SYSTEM from "alpha" to "alphavector" (yes quotes)

4. Add -Dvpp to CPPFLAGS

5. Add -Dvpp to CFLAGS

Make uninstall and make mpp.  With these modifications, the code will
run on the Alpha system with the automatic vector transformations to
EXMOISR, MRFPBL, and CUPARA3.

Note: the configure.user file as-distributed with MM5 has IMPHYS set
to 4. The vector optimizations apply only to IMPHYS=5. Be sure to
make this change in your configure.user file before compiling.

Final note: for debugging, one may also wish to change the FCFLAGS
line in Section 7e to read as follows:

FCFLAGS = -g -Olimit 2000 -fpe0 -align dcommons -align records \
          -convert big_endian $(SPECIAL_OMP)
