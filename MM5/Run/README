Expected input files:

MMINPUT_DOMAIN1  - output from V3 Interpf
BDYOUT_DOMAIN1   - output from V3 Interpf
LOWBDY_DOMAIN1   - output from V3 Interpf
TERRAIN_DOMAIN{2,3,...}   - output from V3 Terrain for nests

MM5 output files:

MMOUT_DOMAIN{1,2,...}
SAVE_DOMAIN{1,2,...}  - if IFSAVE = .TRUE.

For a restart run:

MMINPUT_DOMAIN1  - output from V3 Interpf
BDYOUT_DOMAIN1   - output from V3 Interpf
RESTART_DOMAIN{1,2,...} - renamed from SAVE_DOMAIN{1,2,..}

For a 4DDA run with surface analysis:

RW4DDA_DOMAIN{1,2,...}

For an observational 4DDA run:
