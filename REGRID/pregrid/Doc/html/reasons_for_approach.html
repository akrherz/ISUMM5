The approach of partitioning the functional pieces of REGRID into two sections
was selected for several reasons:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Separation of input tasks from the interpolation tasks removes the complicated
code handling many types of input from the relatively straightforward task
of interpolation.</li>

<li>
Access programs could be (and have been) written for individual data sets,
keeping the code for the input tasks relatively focused.</li>

<li>
Data from different sources are easy to combine.&nbsp; This is most applicable
to surface and soil data sets which are not archived in all atmospheric
analysis data sets.</li>

<li>
All fields output from the pregrid programs are interpolated by REGRIDDER
and passed along to the rest of the modeling system.</li>

<li>
Separate programs and the simple intermediate format allow users to readily
introduce into the MM5 modeling system data&nbsp; sets which are not included
in the set of supported data sources.</li>

<li>
Users introducing data from unsupported sources need only be concerned
with the parts of the package required to decode their own particular data
sets.</li>

<li>
When user intervention is necessary, the modifications are located solely
in an area where the user is a presumed expert: with the new data source.</li>
</ol>
Regarding the last few points above:
<p>There are many, many gridded data sets out there, from many different
sources, in many different formats, and intented for many different users.&nbsp;
If the MM5 system developers tried to support every data set or every format
that comes along, our programs would soon grow to unusable complexity.&nbsp;
Therefore, only a few widely available and frequently used data sets are
"officially" supported for use in REGRID.&nbsp; If a user desires to use
a different data set, the user needs only to write a program to put the
original data into the <a href="intermediate_format.html">intermediate
format</a> (i.e., their own pregrid program).&nbsp; The <i>regridder</i>
program can most likely be used as is.
