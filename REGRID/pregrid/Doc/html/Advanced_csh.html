    <h1>Slightly more advanced use of the pregrid.csh shell script:</h1>

The default setup of the pregrid.csh shell script works well in most
    situations.  But often, a user may find that it can work better
    with some different arrangement of options.  To understand this,
    some discussion is needed about the details of the script.
<p>
There are four conceptual categories of data: 
<li> "3D", which generally includes any atmospheric analyses, whether
	they be at pressure levels or at the surface. </li>
<li> "SST", which indicates the SST data.</li>
<li> "SNOW", which indicates the snow-cover data.</li>
<li> "SOIL", which indicates soil data such as ground temperature
	and soil moisture.</li>
<p>
The main body of the shell script below the user options is a loop
      over the four categories.  For each category, the shell script
      checks the user's setting of the source of analyses, i.e., for
      categories 3D, SST, SNOW, and SOIL, the script checks shell
      variables SRC3D, SRCSST, SRCSNOW, and SRCSOIL, respectively.
      The script compares these shell variables against known options
      (e.g., GRIB, ON84, NAVYSST, NCEP), and when it finds a
      match, it goes into the appropriate subdirectory, links the 
      appropriate files, runs the appropriate program, and moves the
      output files back up to the "pregrid" directory.
<p>
Some pseudo-code may be useful:
<p>
    <blockquote>
      <div class = "code">
	foreach Category ( 3D SST SNOW SOIL )
	<blockquote>
	  if ( user option for $Category matches ON84 ) then
	  <blockquote>
	    Process ON84 Data for the given Category.<br>
	    If ( $Category == 3D ), output files are called "ON84:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SST ), output files are called "ON84_SST:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SNOW ), output files are called "ON84_SNOW:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"
	  </blockquote>
	  else if ( user option for $Category matches NCEP ) then
	  <blockquote>
	    Process NCEP Data for the given Category<br>
	    If ( $Category == 3D ), output files are called "NCEP:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SST ), output files are called "NCEP_SST:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SNOW ), output files are called "NCEP_SNOW:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"
	  </blockquote>
	  else if ( user option for $Category matches NAVYSST ) then
	  <blockquote>
	    Process NAVY SST Data for the given Category<br>
	    Output files are called "NAVY_SST:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	  </blockquote>
	  else if ( user option for $Category matches GRIB ) then
	  <blockquote>
	    Process GRIB Data for the given Category<br>
	    If ( $Category == 3D ), output files are called "FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SST ), output files are called "SST_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SNOW ), output files are called "SNOW_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	    If ( $Category == SOIL ), output files are called "SOIL_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH"<br>
	  </blockquote>
	  endif<br>
	</blockquote>
	end<br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
<p>

This setup works well if each category of data comes in its own
      separate file, or in a separate data set.  The astute reader,
      however, will notice that this setup may result in much
      repetition.  For example, if all of your 3D, SST, SNOW, and SOIL
      fields are in a single GRIB file, that GRIB file must be opened
      and read four separate times, once for each category of data.
      Most of the fields are ignored each time, with only the data
      matching the given category actually extracted.  Things could be
      much more efficient if you could read through the GRIB file once,
      and extract all four categories of data as you go.
<p>
The shell script is set up to allow users to do this easily, at least
      for the GRIB case.  The script variable VT3D (as well as the
      script variables  VTSST, VTSNOW, and VTSOIL ) is interpreted as
      a list of values, each element of the list is a Vtable file
      name.  Before the pregrid_grib.exe program is run, all elements
      of the list are cat'ed (Unix "cat" command) into one Vtable
      file, to be read by the program.  Every field in the GRIB
      file which matches a Vtable entry is extracted.
<p>
So, you may list in VT3D the separate Vtables for the 3D data, SST
      data, SNOW data, and SOIL data.  Turn off all the SRCSST,
      SRCSNOW, SRCSOIL, InSST, InSnow, InSoil script variables.
      Essentially, you're saying that all the data, 3D, SST, SNOW, and
      SOIL, may be considered part of the "3D" dataset, and read in
      one execution of the pregrid_grib.exe program.
<p>
Instead of <br>
<blockquote>
<div class = "code">
set SRC3D = GRIB <br>
set InFiles = Your_Grib_File <br>
set SRCSST = GRIB <br>
set InSST = Your_Grib_File <br>
set SRCSNOW = GRIB <br>
set InSnow = Your_Grib_File <br>
set SRCSOIL = GRIB <br>
set InSoil = Your_Grib_File <br>
set VT3D = Appropriate_3D_Vtable <br>
set VTSST = Appropriate_SST_Vtable <br>
set VTSNOW = Appropriate_SNOW_Vtable <br>
set VTSOIL = Appropriate_SOIL_Vtable <br>
</div>
which runs the program pregrid_grib.exe four times and returns fields
      separated into files called "FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH",
      "SST_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH", "SNOW_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH", and
      "SOIL_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH", <p> 
</blockquote>
you may set <br>
<blockquote>
<div class = "code">
set SRC3D = GRIB <br>
set InFiles = Your_Grib_File <br>
set VT3D = ( \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_3D_Vtable&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SST_Vtable&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SNOW_Vtable&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SOIL_Vtable )<br>
</div>
which returns all the fields in files called "FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH".  It
      is important to note that even though you do not get files
      called "SST_FILE:...", "SNOW_FILE:...", or "SOIL_FILE"...", the
      SST, snow, and soil fields will be in the "FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH" files.
</blockquote>
or you could even set <br>
<blockquote>
<div class = "code">
set SRCSST = GRIB <br>
set InSST = Your_Grib_File <br>
set VTSST = ( \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_3D_Vtable;&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SST_Vtable&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SNOW_Vtable&nbsp;\<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate_SOIL_Vtable )<br>
</div>
which returns all the fields in files called
      "SST_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH".  It is important to note that even
      though the files are labelled SST, they contain all the fields,
      not just SST.
</blockquote>
The same sort of argument works if, for example, you want to get
    atmospheric fields from the ON84 dataset, and SST and Snow from a GRIB
    Dataset (and you choose not to get soil fields).  In this case, you could set:
<blockquote>
<div class = "code">
set SRC3D = ON84 <br>
set InFiles = Your_ON84_File <br>
set SRCSST = GRIB <br>
set InSST = Your_Grib_File <br>
set VTSST = ( Appropriate_SST_Vtable Appropriate_SNOW_Vtable )<br>
</div>
which returns the atmospheric fields in files called
      "ON84:YYYY-MM-DD_HH", and the SST and Snow fields in files
      called "SST_FILE:YYYY-MM-DD_HH".  Again, note that even though
      the file is labelled "SST_FILE" and there is no "SNOW_FILE",
      both SST and SNOW fields are in the "SST_FILE".  Note also that 
      you do not need to set the VT3D variable, because your SRC3D is
      ON84 and not GRIB.
