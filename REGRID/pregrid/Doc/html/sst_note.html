5. A note about sea-surface temperatures and skin temperatures</h2>

    The way sea-surface temperatures are archived seems to vary widely from
    dataset to dataset.  In REGRID parlance, we make a 
    distinction between <i><b>sea-surface temperature</b></i> and <i><b>skin
    temperature</b></i>.  A <i><b>sea-surface temperature</b></i> field represents the
    temperature of the water (whether that's the temperature at the
    water surface or temperature of some layer at the top of the
    water).  Over land, this field doesn't really have any meaning,
    and in many datasets the values are smoothly interpolated from
    water points.  Example:<br> <img src="images/sst.gif" width="593" height="413"
				     alt="(Example)">.  <br><br><br>

    A <i><b>skin temperature</b></i> field represents the temperature
    of the surface of the earth, whether that surface is land or
    water.  Thus, in summer for example, you may wind up with large
    temperature gradients between warm land points and cold water
    points.  Example:<br> <img src="images/skin.gif" width="593" height="413"
				     alt="(Example)">.  <br>  <br><br>

    The skin temperature can be tricky to use within the MM5 modeling
    system, because of the horizontal interpolation to the MM5 grid.
    Horizontal interpolation to a point near the coast can wind up
    being an interpolation from a land point and a water point.  If,
    for example, the summertime ground temperature is considerably
    warmer than the water temperature, you may wind up with
    unreasonably cold ground temperatures and unreasonably warm water
    temperatures at the coast.  This will be particularly noticeable
    when interpolating to an MM5 grid that has a much higher
    horizontal resolution that the source dataset. <br><br>

    At the REGRID stage, fields SST and SKINTEMP are treated
    identically.  They are simply interpolated to the MM5 horizontal
    grid, with no concern for what may happen at the coast.<br><br>

    Later in the MM5 modeling system, in program INTERPF, fields
    called SST and SKINTEMP are interpreted differently.  If an SST
    field is found, INTERPF will interpret that field as one that can
    be used as an instantaneous field appropriate for water
    temperatures, which may vary in time.  INTERPF will create a
    lower-boundary-conditions file (LOWBDY) with an SST field for each
    analysis time.  This field will be called TSEASFC.  If there is no
    SST field, but a SKINTEMP field is found, INTERPF will average
    SKINTEMP for all times, and write that average as a single,
    time-invariant TSEASFC field to the LOWBDY file.  This averaging
    is done to remove the diurnal variation of the skin temperature
    over land in the averaged, time-invariant TSEASFC field. <br><br>

    In short, fields called SST will be interpreted as instantaneous
    water-temperature fields and will allow time-varying sea-surface
    temperatures
