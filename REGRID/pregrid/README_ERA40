Dear User,

If you do not get your ERA40 data from NCAR/DSS, 
these notes may not apply to you.

#####################################################################

If you are planning on running the model with ERA 40 data, 
please take note of the following.

DATA needed:
	From DSS ds118.1: 
		1. download the 3D dataset file
	From DSS ds118.0: 
		1. download the PRIMARY surface data file 
		2. download the single INVARIANT file that
 		   contain the SOILHGT and LANDSEA data fields
		   This is dataset U01487
		   (This dataset is used to created the constants file
		    SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12. If you do not wish to 
		    create this file, you can use the one supplied in
		    the REGRID/regridder director.)

Run pregid.csh as you will normally run this script. The data files
needed to run the script are the 3D dataset from ds118.1 and the
PRIMARY surface data file from ds118.0
You will need the following Vtables:
	Vtable.ERA43D
	Vtable.ERA4SST
	Vtable.ERA4SNOW
	Vtable.ERA4SOIL

Use / create the SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12 file
1. The file SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12 is available in REGRID/regridder
   and it can be used as is, OR;
2. Create the SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12 file
   Run pregrid_era40_int.csh
   All you need to change in this script is the location (DataDir) of 
   the data file U01487
   This script will read the data file U01487 and with the use of 
   Vtable.ERA4SIVT, it will create the file SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12 

When running regridder, you need to include the file
SIVT_FILE:1957-09-01_12, as a "constants_full_name", in record3 of the
namelist.input file.
