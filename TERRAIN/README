VERSION 3 TERRAIN PROGRAM (release-3-7)
(Updated December 23, 2004)

This is the main directory of the TERRAIN program in the MM5 modeling 
system Version 3. Everything a user needs to run the Terrain program 
(except for NCAR Graphics) is contained in this directory.

Program Terrain does not require NCAR Graphics to run. But with NCAR
Graphics, Terrain will generate plots that display the domain and
fields produced by the program.

NCAR Graphics is a licensed software, but part of it has become free.
TERRAIN program only requires this part of the NCAR Graphics to produce
plots. For information on NCAR Graphics, please visit

    http://ngwww.ucar.edu/info/pricing.html

If you have NCAR Graphics, set the environment variable NCARG_ROOT
either in .cshrc file, or type it before you compiler and run TERRAIN:

    setenv NCARG_ROOT /usr/local/ncarg (or the directory where NCAR 
                                        Graphics is installed)

All fortran source code is located in directory src/. 

For questions, please send emails to mesouser@ucar.edu

What is in V3 TERRAIN?

This version of terrain program is able to process global 30 sec 
topography data, use global 30 sec vegetation data to create 
higher resolution landuse categories, use land-water mask field 
created with high resolution vegetation date to define coastlines,
and process additional data required to run land-surface module in MM5.

In addition to elevation and landuse data, V3 TERRAIN output also 
contains terrestrial output fields: Coriolis parameter, map scale
factors on dot and cross points, latitudes and longitudes on dot
and cross points.

V3 TERRAIN program uses V3 data format, which is different from
that in V2. For details on V3 data format, please see

http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/mm5v3.html

******* IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR 3.5 RELEASE *******

Starting from 3-5 release, the vegetation, landwater mask, and soil data
have been updated. The vegetation data are updated based on the 30-second
resolution USGS Version 2 data. For data information, please see
http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/glcc/glcc.html.
The landwater mask data are recreated using the vegetation data. 
These two types of data are now located at the center of a grid box.

The soil data are updated with 5-minute global United Nation
FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) dataset and 30-second STATSGO 
US dataset. (For more information, please
see: http://www.fao.org/ag/AGL/agll/dsmw.htm)
Over the Antarctic, soil type is assumed to be glacier (the FAO dataset
didn't provide data over Antarctic).
This is a great improvement over the 1-degree global dataset we had prior 
to this release. Two layers of soil
category data are provided in this release: one from 0 - 30 cm layer, and
the other from 30 - 100 cm layer. User may choose to use either by setting
a script variable in the new deck (BotSoil). A view of the two layer soil
data over US can been seen at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/mm5v3/v3prep.html.

The new data are available from ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/mesouser/MM5V3/TERRAIN_DATA.

NOTE that you must use the new terrain.deck and new TERRAIN.TAR file in
V3.5 release to access the new vegetation and landwater mask data. You may
download the new soil data and use the old TERRAIN program.

The complete list of data files provided by mesouser is in Data/README file.

******* IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR 3.4 RELEASE *******

Starting from 3-4 release, the number of input data resolution has increased
from five (at 1 degree, 30 min, 10 min, 5 min and 30 second resolution) 
to six with an additional 2-minutes resolution data (approximately 3.7 km).
The 2-minute data are provided separately from the lower resolution datasets
and 30-second dataset. 
The purpose of this addition is to allow users to use high resolution
terrestrial datasets for model runs at a few kilometer resolution without
accessing the 30 sec data which requires a large amount of job memory.

Also starting with 3-4 release, the terrain elevation data at 1 degree,
30, 10, and 5 minute resolution are recreated from the USGS 30 second
dataset. The new dataset is provided in a new tar file: TER.TAR.gz, and
is separated from the old landuse dataset, which is now in LANDUSE-OLD.TAR.gz.
The new 2 min data are also created from the 30 second dataset.

The complete list of data files provided by mesouser is in Data/README file.

******* IMPORTANT FOR 3.1 RELEASE *******

Starting from 3-1 release, all TERRAIN input data files are reprocessed
and now are in direct access format. You must use the new deck to run
3-1 or newer program and the new deck will go to NCAR ftp site to 
download new data.

*****************************************

This version of terrain program should run on a number of platforms:
SGI, DEC_Alpha, Cray, Sun, HP, IBM, and PC running Linux. 
Default compilation options are provided for these platforms.

Platforms tested are: SGI, DEC_Alpha, Sun, Cray, IBM, and PC running Linux.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

Even though the new landuse data created from the USGS 30 sec vegetation
data have much higher resolution than the old 10 min landuse data, 
the correctness and representativeness of the landuse are
not checked. Users are advised to check the data carefully before 
proceeding. Landuse physical properties may be modified in MM5 by
editing the ascii file LANDUSE.TBL in the Run/ of MM5 tar file.

When using the high-resolution datasets, expect terrain program to require
large amount of memory and disk space. For example, if there is 1 Gb of
memory on a workstation, one can typically use the 30 sec dataset to cover
a 10 deg by 10 deg area. The 30 sec global vegetation and soil category
data each occupies about 1 Gb of disk space.

An option to exclude NCAR Graphics is also included. To select not to use 
NCAR Graphics, set NCARGRAPHICS = "NONCARG" in Makefile file. You may also
need to empty the LOCAL_LIBRARIES line where NCAR Graphics library is defined.

How to run Terrain program:

   Type 'make terrain.deck' first to create a deck for your machine. Then
   edit the deck to select appropriate options, parameter statements, and
   namelist options. Type './terrain.deck' to compile and run the program.
   In this case, make is executed inside the deck.

   Type chmod +x terrain.deck, if necessary.

   NOTE that the V3-4 terrain deck has changed. So please go through the
   deck and namelist carefully to fill in appropriate values. Since most
   of the script variables are removed (such as TerPlt), you must now
   fill the namelist directly. These namelists are: 
   IFTER, IFILL, LSMDATA and VEGTYPE.

   OR (recommended only for experienced users)

   There are two ways to compile and run terrain program. If you choose
   to use either the old, or USGS landuse datasets, your domain
   dimensions are less than 100 by 100 in each dimension respectively
   (including expanded dimensions), and you are not using 30 sec dataset, 
   you can simply type 'make' to compile the code. 

   If your domain dimensions are bigger than 100 by 100, or you choose to
   use 30 sec dataset (or use very large domain with 5 min or 10 min terrain
   data), you need first to modify two parameter include files
   in src/ directory: parame.incl and paramed.incl. Then type 'make' to
   compile.

   Note on data dimensions ITRH and JTRH: These are dimensions of data 
   covering the area of your interest, not original data.

   If you would like to use the SiB data set, you need to do two more things
   in src/ directory before you compile: 

   1. cp paramesv0.inc paramesv.incl
   2. cp vs_data0.incl vs_data.incl

   After compiling the program, type 'make terrain.deck' to create a deck
   for your machine, edit options in the deck, and type './terrain.deck' to
   run the program.

   If the compilation is successful, 3 executables will be generated in the
   src/ directory: 

   data_area.exe: calculate data area covered by 30 sec dataset, and decide 
                  which tile(s) of USGS global dataset is required.
   rdem.exe:      reconstruct USGS dataset to be used by terrain program.
   terrain.exe:   generate terrain output fields.

   If your terrain job is successfully completed, you should see the following
   output files appearing in the top directory:

   TER.PLT (on some machine, gmeta): a plot file containing your domain 
                    configuration, and contour plots, if you have NCAR Graphics.
   TERRAIN_DOMAINx: binary output from terrain program for domain x, and to be 
                    used by later MM5 programs. For example, TERRAIN_DOMAIN1 is 
                    a required input file for program Regrid.

   You can look at the plots by using NCAR Graphics utility idt: idt TER.PLT. 

   Make sure you have the following in your .cshrc file before you use
   NCAR Graphics:

   setenv NCARG_ROOT /usr/local/ncarg (or where NCAR Graphics is installed)

------------------------------------------------

More about Terrain:

1. The terrain deck will automatically go to NCAR's anonymous ftp site to get
   the terrestrial datasets based on the resolution you requested in the 
   namelist (NTYPE). It makes the use of the ftp shell, ftp.csh, in Data directory.
   (ftp.csh may be run separately to obtain data, but in this case, you must
   edit the script and define some variables.)



2. If you would like to use the 30 sec elevation data, set NTYPE = 6 for
   the particular nest. Also define script variable Where30sTer in the deck
   to tell the deck where to locate the data. The data can be downloaded to
   your local disk prior to running Terrain program.

   If you tell the deck to ftp data, the deck (via another ftp script, ftp30s.csh,
   in Data/ directory) will automatically go to USGS ftp site to get the data.
   (USGS ftp site: ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/gtopo30/global)

   Note that the old 30 sec US dataset is not usable in this and previous V3 
   releases. One will have to use the global 30 sec data instead.

   A new option is added in 3-1 release to use single tile USGS global 30 sec
   elevation. This data file is only available from NCAR/MSS (1.9 Gb). If you
   would like to obtain this file, contact mesouser.

3. If you get a 'segmentation faults' error when executing this program,
   check the domain dimensions defined in namelist, the PARAMETER statement
   in the deck, do a 'make clean', and type './terrain.deck' to start
   make and execution again.

4. You can run the job on Cray and use the OutIEEE switch in the Cray
   deck to create a dataset for workstation.

5. When working on NCAR's Cray, you may obtain a batch deck from
   ~mesouser/MM5V3/terrain.deck.cray, edit it, and submit it to
   Cray batch job queue. Note that the deck for release 3.4 is different from
   the decks for previous releases.

*** A Note about Data:

Six resolution datasets are available for elevation, vegetation and 
land-water mask (the land-water mask data are derived from vegetation data).
These are 60 min (or 1 deg), 30 min, 10 min, 5 min, 2 min and 30 sec. 
The coarser resolution datasets are derived from the 30 sec datasets
(except the old 13-category landuse data).

     (The USGS data are updated in V3.5)

     land-water mask data based SiB/USGS vegetation data: (depending on VEGTYPE)

     LANDWATERMASK-SIB.TAR.gz   - 1 deg, 30, 10, 5 min resolution
     LWMASK-SIB.02.gz           - 2 min resolution
     LWMASK-SIB.30s.gz          - 30 sec resolution

USGS: This is a global dataset, with the exception of Antarctica, part of
Greenland and Russia (we are looking for ways to fill the gaps).
Terrain creates 24 category landuse data, including urban. The category
for water is 16.

SiB:  This is a regional datasets with boundaries from 60W - 180W, and
0N - 90N (basically North America without the NE corner of Canada).
Terrain creates 16 category landuse data without urban. The category for
water is 15. Urban is not one of the categories. 
This dataset is the same used in NCEP's Eta model.

   If you wish to process data for LSM model option in MM5, set LSMDATA=.TRUE. in
   the deck, you'll obtain additional data:

   LSM data: 

     SOILCAT.TAR.gz   - soil category data at 1 deg, 30, 10, 5 min resolution
     SOILCAT.02.gz    - soil category data at 2 min resolution
     SOILCAT.30s.gz   - soil category data at 30 sec resolution
     (soil category data are updated for V3.5, and they are now for top 0 - 30 cm layer)
     SOILTEMP.60      - deep soil temperature at 1 deg resolution
     VEG-FRACTION.10.gz   - vegetation fraction data at 10 min resolution

     (30 - 100 cm layer soil category data)
     SOILCATB.TAR.gz   - soil category data at 1 deg, 30, 10, 5 min resolution
     SOILCATB.02.gz    - soil category data at 2 min resolution
     SOILCATB.30s.gz   - soil category data at 30 sec resolution


Note that soil category data over much of the world have 5 minute resolution since
V3.5 release. It is 30 sec resolution over the US. Hence data at other resolutions 
are created from either the 5 minute or 30 sec datasets.

A special note about data over Hawaii Islands:

- The new 5-min soil data show improvement over previous 1-degree dataset.

- The new vegetation data have only urban category over the islands, but none others.
  So we filled the rest of the islands with dominant landuse categories around 
  similar latitude circles - this turns up to be mixed forest (category 15). This
  is different from what is over the islands before which was savanna (category 10).


---------------------------------------------------------

Known problem with TERRAIN:

- Over the poles, terrain may produce errorous terrain and other
  terrestrial fields at the pole and along dateline if even grid 
  dimensions are used. Using odd grid dimensions will work, at
  least for a single domain.
