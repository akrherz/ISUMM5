Changes and improvements:

- Add a print statement when 30sec elevation data is accessed.

  Affected files:
  src/terdrv.F

- Add option "dataclean" to Makefile 
  This will clean up all data files in the TERRAIN/Data 
  directory and well as remove the entire TERRAIN/Data30s
  directory

  Affected files:
  Makefile

- Make IBM batch jobs more user friendly

  Affected files:
  Templates/terrain.deck.ibm.batch

- Add batch terrain job script for NCAR IBM for running large
  terrain jobs. This deck is available on NCAR's computer under
  ~mesouser/MM5V3/IBM


========================================================

Bug fixes and changes in V3.5:

1. Bug fixes:

- Correct a problem with Makefile for Linux (Thanks to Matthew Johnson
  of Air Quality Bureau, Iowa). (This change has been in TERRAIN.TAR file
  since 11/28/00.)

  Affected file:
  Makefile

- Add missing script variable (Where30sTer) in terrain deck for Cray.
  Note, if you run Terrain job on Cray using 30 sec data, set time
  limit to be very large, as gunzip files will take a very long time.
  (This change has been in TERRAIN.TAR file since 11/28/00.)

  Affected file:
  Templates/terrain.deck.cray

- Minor correction in ftp script that gets the 30 sec elevation data.
  
  Affected file:
  Data/ftp30s.csh

- Remove &END in Data/namelist.usgsdata and namelist.sigdata.

- Remove data coverage check for global datasets. Prevents occational
  STOP in terrain program.

  Affected file:
  src/terdrv.F, crlwmsk.F, crsoil.F

- Change print format so that it can print grid numbers greater than 99.

  Affected file:
  src/outpt.F

- Correct an error in calculating deep soil T over island.

  Affected file:
  src/patch.F 

- Correct a problem with TERRAIN plotting when terrain output files
  with 100x90 dimensions.

  Affected file:
  src/plots.F

- Correct a problem with landwater masking plot: it will now place
  the landwater mask value in correct location on the map.

  Affected file:
  src/pltter.F

- Correct a problem with using 2 min TERRAIN input data - the data
  should be located at the center of a grid box.

  Affected file:
  src/rdldtr.F

- Correction to domain checks - it will stop TERRAIN if the check fails.

  Affected file:
  src/setup.F 

- Check data dimensions separately.

  Affected file:
  src/terdrv.F

- Subroutine crlnd must be called if IFEZFUG is true.

  Affected file:
  src/terdrv.F

- Correction to Mercator map projection near dateline.
  (Thanks to AFWA.)

  Affected file:
  src/terrestial_info.F

- Remove namelist variable DATASW from all decks. The option of allowing
  the model to choose a resolution isn't always working. 


2. Changes and improvements:

- README files in top directory and Data/ directory are updated to 
  reflect the new available data.

- Global soil category data are updated from 1 degree resolution to
  5 minutes resolution from USGS FAO dataset. Over the continental
  US (CONUS), the data resolution is still 30 seconds.

  In addition, two layers of soil data are provided: 0 - 30 cm top soil 
  layer, 30-100 cm bottom soil layer.

  The new input data are in ftp://ftp.ucar.edu/mesouser/MM5V3/TERRAIN_DATA

- USGS 30-seconda, 24-categroy vegetation data are updated with the 
  USGS Version 2 data. The landwater mask data are recreated using
  the new vegetation data. All lower resolution data (2, 5, 10, 30
  and 60 min) are recreated. The new data are located at the center
  of a grid box. This means that the old TERRAIN tar file cannot be
  used to read the new data files.

- All decks are updated to use ./terrain.exe, instead of terrain.exe.

  Decks are also modified to allow a user to choose different soil data.

- ftp.csh is modified to access new data in new directory. A new ftp2.csh 
  is included to access different soil data.

- Add minor version number in TERRAIN's header.

- vs_data1.incl is removed since it is no longer used.


========================================================

Bug fixes and changes in V3.4:

Bug fixes:

- Fix a problem when MAXNES is greater than the number of data
  types.

  Affected file:
  src/tfudge.F

- Fix print option. IPRTHT = .T. will now generate print of all
  processed fields at mesh points. 

  Affected file:
  src/finprt.F

- Fix a bound check for polar projection option.

  Affected file:
  src/check_data.F, mxmnll.F

- Correct a typo in plots.F in calling error handler.

  Affected file:
  src/plots.F

- Print out exact dimensions (ITRH and JTRH) required to process data.
  (change in tar file since 10/12/00).

  Affected file:
  src/terdrv.F

- Add 'binary' to ftp script in the decks to ensure data are
  acquired correctly from NCAR's ftp site.
  (change in tar file since 5/16/00)

  Affected files:
  Templates/terrain.deck.*

- Correct a problem of deep soil temperature not being reset
  along nest interface in the adjustment. This causes the 
  deep soil temp on the nest boundary being not consistent with
  that in the coarse domain. Affect land-surface model data 
  option only. (change in tar file since 4/12/00)

  Affected file:
  src/tfudge.F

- Correct a problem in openning land-water mask file when a 
  combination of options of IFEZFUG=T and NewLandUse=T is used.
  (change in tar file since 3/10/00)

  Affected file:
  src/setup.F

- Clean up field name in subheader for vegetation fraction.
  (change in tar file since 3/10/00)

  Affected file:
  src/output.F

- All USGS vegetation data files and land-water mask data files 
  are updated to include Hawaii Islands, and a few other Pacific Islands.


Changes and improvements:

- Add a 2-minute resolution data (~3.7 km) input option. This fills a
  gap in data resolution between 5 min (~9 km) and 30 sec (~1 km), and 
  allows a user to make use of high-resolution data without the excessive
  requirement on computer memory. The 2-min data are created from the 
  USGS 30 second dataset.

  Affected files:
  src/anal2.F, crlwmsk.F, crsoil.F, data_area.F, finprt.F,
      interp.F, io.incl, ltdata.incl, maps.incl, mxmnll.F, output.F, 
      paramed.incl, plots.F, pltter.F, rdldtr.F, replace.F, search.F,
      setup.F, terdrv.F, terrain.F, tfudge.F, vs_cmn1.incl, vs_data.incl,
      vs_data0.incl, vs_data2.incl

- Elevation data at 1 degree, 30, 10 and 5 minute resolutions are 
  recreated from the USGS 30 second dataset. This allows consistency
  between datasets, and also correct a number of data problems discovered
  in these low-resolution datasets. A user will see (hopefully) small
  differences between data created in this and previous releases.

- Major change in decks. The purposes of the change include: accomodate
  additional data input option, and separate ftp functions from the deck.
  The new decks are smaller, and with a number of script variables removed.
  Users are required to fill the namelist variables that are used to be
  filled via script variables (e.g. IFTER, IFILL, etc.). Two new namelist
  variables are added to better help user to select data option: LSMDATA,
  and VEGTYPE. A program is added to read the namelist and pass the options
  to ftp scripts. 

  Because of all these changes, one must recreate a new deck for use of 
  release-3-4 code, and data. 

  Affected files:
  Templates/terrain.deck.*
  src/Makefile, namelist.incl, setup.F, rdnml.F (new)
  Data/ftp.csh, ftp30s.csh, namelist.usgsdata, namelist.sibdata (all new)

- Domain configuration check (whether the nest is too close to its mother
  domain) is now done even if terrain data are not generated.

  Affected file:
  src/setup.F

- Use of IPRINT to control print output. IPRINT = 1 will generate
  a terrain.print.out file that similar to before, while the default
  IPRINT = 0 will only generate limited output in terrain.print.out.

  Affected files:
  src/crlnd.F, crlwmsk.F, crsoil.F, crter.F, crvst.F, crvst30s.F,
      finprt.F, lakes.F, mxmnll.F, output.F, plotcon.F, plots.F,
      rdldtr.F, replace.F, setup.F, smthtr.F, soil_tg.F, terdrv.F,
      terrain.F, tfudge.F, water_vfr.F, watercheck.F, xyobsll.F

- Modify earth rotation parameter omega to be the same as in MM5.

  Affected file:
  src/terrestial_info.F

- Allow boundary feedback in soil and vegetation category data, since 
  these data are required input for the new Pleim-Xiu LSM in MM5.
  Generation of these extra data is controled by namelist variable IEXTRA.

  Affected file:
  src/tfudge.F
  Templates/terrain.deck.*

- Add compile option for Linux. (change in tar file since 5/2/00)
  Also makes a few changes so that PGI compiler will not complain.

  Affected file:
  Makefile
  src/Makefile, plots.F, pltter.F

- Add comments in Makefile regarding using no-NCAR-Graphics option.

  Affected files:
  Makefile

=======================================

Updated 1/24/00:

- The way terrain's executables are created is simplified. A user no
  longer needs to edit configure.make file (the file is removed).
  A user can simply type 'make' to create terrain executables if the
  default parameter statements meet the requirement. For details, see
  README file.
